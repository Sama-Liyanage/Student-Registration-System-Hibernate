# Student-Registration-System-Hibernate

*The Sipsewana institute is a prominent institute that provides different types of vocational training
programs for the youth in Sri Lanka. The institute was established a few decades ago and now
accommodates about 5000 students per year.*
*In this institute, the student registration process was done manually so far by keeping records on
physical files so far since its establishment. However, as the number of students keeps increasing day
by day, management is facing more and more problems regarding keeping records of the students
and the course programs.*

*So the institution has decided to implement a system for the registration process.*
